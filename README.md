# Drashya: A site to guide farmers
In today's world information is everything. Right information at right time can change lives. However such information is hard to access specially for our farmers. Understanding this situation Team cuninFox has decided to build Drashya. Literaly meaning something mesmerising to look at Drashya can play a vital role in helping the farmers of India by providing information they need.


Drashya is currently made specifically for farmers of Madhya Pradesh. Due to the exsistance of geographic and topographic diversity in India it was concluded that it would be best made for a specific state so that accurate information can be provided.
